# DataExtraction-CSV Script
Data Extraction from text file using regex method and write it to CSV file for network devices.

This is my prototype code, so feel free to use it and make brach base from this code, I hope it can help others. 
There is still a lot to work on such as write the extracted data to CSV with beautiful formated CSV, adding more Regex for specific line, etc. Also the to test the regex code I'm using https://regexr.com/ for testing the regex code.

The example file will be provided in 'Sample File' folder once it is available.
